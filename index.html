          <h1 class="Name">My Inspiration: Terrence Ruffin</h1>
          <p class="homeText">Terrence Ruffin is an IFBB professional Classic Physique athlete, trainer and nutrition consultant from the United States. He first competed at 19 and two years later at 21, he earned his Pro Card that set the stage for him climbing the Classic Physique ladder. Ruffin's best finishes were 2nd at the 2020 and 2021 Classic Physique Olympia and 1st at the Arnold Classic 2021 Classic Physique.</p>
          <p class="moreHomeText">In the offseason, Terrence consumes around 3,700 calories to pack on muscle size and to have enough power and energy to train. Ruffin mostly works out in the mornings and will have a workout drink.[4] Of course, his diet may change every now and then which is common with most competitors. His food choices are more tolerable when he's not competing( in the offseason) but it helps him to maintain his physique.</p>
